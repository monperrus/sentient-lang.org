<pre><code class="language-sentient"># I have a problem at work that I _think_ is the Knapsack Problem but perhaps
# someone here can help me research/find a heuristic solution: we have access
# to the &lt;redacted&gt; and get a finite number of “rules” we can use (e.g. 1000)
# and each rule can only be 1024 characters long and have a maximum of 30
# operators in them (e.g. “foo OR bar OR baz”), we have a list of domains
# (e.g. example.com, example.org) we want to pack domains into rules as
# efficiently as possible in the minimum number of rules.

# Here's an attempt at a Sentient program to solve the decision version of
# this problem, i.e. Can 100 domains fit into 5 rules?
# You could then ratchet the number of rules down by binary search to find
# the minimum number of rules.

# Some constants of the problem.
maxLength = 1024;
maxOrs = 30;
orLength = 4;

# An array containing the length of each domain.
array100&lt;int&gt; domains;

# A 2D array containing whether each domain is a member of each rule.
# The number of rules can be reduced to see if the problem can be satisfied with
# fewer rules. The number of members should match the number of domains.
array5&lt;array10&lt;bool&gt;&gt; ruleMembers;

# All domain lengths must be positive.
domains.each(function (length) {
  invariant length.positive?;
});

# Track how many domains have been allocated to rules.
accountedFor = 0;

# Go through the members of each rule.
ruleMembers.each(function^ (members, rule) {
  numberOfDomains = 0;
  lengthOfRule = 0;

  # Go through all the domains.
  domains.each(function^ (length, index) {
    # Check whether the current domain is a member of the rule.
    isMember = members[index];

    # If it is, increment the number of domains and add to the rule length.
    numberOfDomains += isMember ? 1 : 0;
    lengthOfRule += isMember ? length : 0;
  });

  # Add the ' OR ' lengths to the rule length.
  numberOfOrs = numberOfDomains - 1;
  lengthOfRule += numberOfOrs * orLength;

  # The rule should not exceed 1024 characters.
  invariant lengthOfRule &lt;= maxLength;

  # The rule should not contain more than 30 ORs.
  invariant numberOfOrs &lt;= maxOrs;

  # These domains are now accounted for.
  accountedFor += numberOfDomains;
});

# All domains should now be accounted for.
invariant accountedFor == domains.count;

# Allow the domains to be set at runtime.
# Return the rule members as output.
